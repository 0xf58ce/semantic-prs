## Configuration
deposit.
By default, no configuration is necessary. The default behaviour is that only the PR title or at least one commit message needs to follow the [Conventional Commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

This can be changed by creating a `semantic.yml` file in your `.github` directory. Note, the configuration added to your `semantic.yml` file won't be reflected until the file has been merged into your repository's default branch.
